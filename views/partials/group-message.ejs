  Mammals, a class of warm-blooded vertebrates, encompass an incredible diversity of species adapted
  to various habitats worldwide. With over 6,000 known species, they range from tiny shrews to
  massive blue whales. What distinguishes mammals is their possession of mammary glands, which
  produce milk to nourish their young. Most mammals give birth to live young, although a few, like
  monotremes, lay eggs. Mammals exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from the intricate social
  structures of elephants to the solitary habits of some big cats. They play vital roles in
  ecosystems as herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and scavengers, contributing to the balance of
  nature.
